### Work

I'm (+-lead) developer and devops. I wrote programs for food (professionally) on almost every known ancient programming language, I wrote programs for computers, phones, chips, engines, gpu cards etc. Have master of math degree but not sure I remember anything. 

Now I mostly write on javascript (prefer flowtype/typescript/react/svelte/relay/graphql/hasura), and have +- good skill with gcloud/(hashicorp tech) as devops.
